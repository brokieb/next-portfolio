This is my personal portfolio page created in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

For correctly run my app you must connect to MongoDB database, and create MONGO_DV env variable in .env file.

After that run server with: 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
